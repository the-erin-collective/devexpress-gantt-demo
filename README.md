# devexpress-gantt-demo
Fastify &amp; Prisma server with React client

This demos the devexpress gantt chart, with the various entites (tasks / resources / dependencies / resource assignments) being served by the server on localhost:8080 and the client on localhost:3000 calls the devexpress-gantt constructor once the entities are recieved from the server.
